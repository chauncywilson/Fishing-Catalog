# Fishing-Catalog

## Synopsis
A brief section of code to help beginners navigate and understand the world of fishing lures and the most successful types in Southern Utah.

## Motivation
I want more people to be able to get in the fishing community but it can be daunting to know what you might need or want.

## How to Run
The necessary code "fishing catalog1.1.0" and a .txt file named wishlist.

## Code Example
Here is a sample of how the code will help users understand what the product is, how to use it, and how much it might cost.

            System.out.println("\nPanther Martins help with precise casting, and work best in small river-like" +
                    "\nconditions. Jakes, Kastmasters, and Super Dupers are heavier and therefore can be cast" +
                    "\nfarther. They are best used in ponds.");

            System.out.println("1) Panther Martin: $5.00\n2) Jakes Spin-A-Lure: $4.00\n3) Kastmaster: $5.00\n4)" +
                    " Super Duper: $5.00\n5) Go Back");

            int select = input.nextInt();


            //Problem with writing into the file
        switch (select) {
            case 1 :
                pantherMartin++;
                break;

            case 2 :
                jakes++;
                break;

            case 3 :
                kastmaster++;
                break;

            case 4 :
                superDuper++;
                break;

            case 5 : tackleVariants();
        }
            spinners();
        }

If you would like to provide your own insight or report on a bugged feature, you can reach me at chauncy2192@gmail.com. 

I would like to thank our local fishermen for providing their expirience in tackle that they use while fishing.
